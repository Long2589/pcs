		<h2>Concerns About Learning HTML</h2>
		<p>I don't really have any concerns about learning HTML. It's a little intimidating since I have no prior experience with coding, but I love learning new things, so I'm looking forward to learning more about this language.
		<br />I'd love to be able to build professional-looking websites with ease, and there's so much I don't know! At this point, I know enough to realize that I need to learn CSS and Javascript in addition to HTML, but that's about the extent of my knowledge. I guess it's a good thing I like to learn ;)</p>
